## React + Redux + React Router (v4) + SCSS  ðŸ“¡

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/moahmed123/react-teditor my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

### Development
```
npm start
```

Only edit `.scss` files, `.css` files are compiled and reloaded automatically.  
Create a `.env.local` file to store local environment variables.

### Production
```
npm run build
```

Running the `build` script (defined in `package.json`) creates an optimized production build, and outputs static files to the `build` folder.
